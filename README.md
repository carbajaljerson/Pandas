### Content

Notebooks with code and comments.
Dataset used for exploration with the Pandas library.


- DataFrameOperations

    This notebook includes activities such as exploring DataFrame rows with iloc (index) and loc (labels), calculating the number of duplicates, generating descriptive statistics, changing column names, filtering, grouping, and aggregating columns.

    
### Execution in Google Colab

The Library Import section should be as follows

```bash
from google.colab import drive
import pandas as pd
```

Later, the Data Directory section should be added for access to the folder where the Dataset is located.

```bash
drive.mount('/content/drive')
%cd '/content/drive/MyDrive/data'
```
